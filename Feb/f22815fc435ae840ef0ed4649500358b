BY BEAUTY NYUKE A NEW human settlement policy to address problems of land barons as well as illegal settlements is on the cards, National Housing and Social Amenities deputy minister Yeukai Simbanegavi has revealed. She told Parliament last week that the policy would also benefit communities displaced by natural disasters such as flash floods and cyclones. “We have a new human settlement policy that is going to be launched very soon,” Simbanegavi said. “This one would also tackle issues of people who are going to be displaced by natural disasters, especially those that have been allocated land in the wetlands and other undesignated areas,’’ she said. The deputy minister said the policy would provide alternative land for communities illegally settled on wetlands and other undesignated sites. “So far, we have identified about six farms and these will be considered for those people who have suffered the recent natural disasters by having their houses flooded.”
