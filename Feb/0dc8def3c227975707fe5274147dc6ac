BY NIZBERT MOYO ZIMBABWE could be hit by Cyclone Faraji, a name drawn from Kenya, barely a month after tropical Cyclone Eloise left a trail of destruction in Manicaland, Masvingo and Matabeleland South provinces. Bulawayo provincial chief meteorological officer Chiposi Ngulube told NewsDay that although it was unclear yesterday when the cyclone would strike, there were strong indications that the country will once again be a victim. “The next cyclone is called Faraji. It is true that Eloise was the fifth cyclone to form in the South West Indian Ocean which is Regional Association1 and Zimbabwe falls under this region,” Ngulube said. “The effects of the last two cyclones — Chalane and Eloise — were really felt in Zimbabwe. When and where the next disturbance will occur cannot be predicted, but the cyclone season is February.’’ He said February is the time when there would be the largest number of cyclones forming, adding that not every cyclone will affect Zimbabwe since it varied on its position. Environment, Water and Climate Change minister Nqobizitha Mangaliso Ndlovu said most of the storms reach Zimbabwe as tropical cyclones after losing momentum. Ndlovu advised people in Chimanimani and surrounding areas to move away from cyclone-prone areas. “They need to move away from cyclone-prone areas. This is the path of the cyclone. They will always be affected because of their proximity to Mozambique,’’ Ndlovu said, adding that government would come up with research on how to deal with calamities. Tropical Cyclone Eloise which severely affected Mozambique and brought rain and powerful winds of around 130km sweeping across Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa, left a trail of destruction in the sub-region.
