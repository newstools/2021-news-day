BY REX MPHISA A SOUTH AFRICAN cross-border haulage trucking company has threatened to sue Raubex Construction Company following an accident involving its truck inside the Beitbridge Border Post. Docfin Trading believes the truck overturned due to negligence on part of Raubex Construction, which is upgrading the border post. A traffic police report seen by NewsDay seems to suggest that the accident was a result of an uneven surface. Raubex, a South Africa-listed company, is currently upgrading the Beitbridge Border Post. The truck fell on its side in the area under construction after one of its trailers tipped over due to an uneven slope. Herkie Sandenbegh, engineer in charge of Raubex at Beitbridge, did not respond to questions or even acknowledge receipt of inquiries from NewsDay. The Department of Customs and Excise, who are custodians of the border post, however, said concerns had been raised by some transporters about the uneven surfaces. “The concern was noted and contractors on the ground have since attended to the required repairs. “The channel will be continuously monitored to ensure that it is maintained in a safe and usable condition,” said Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) spokesperson Francis Chimanda said. The Customs and Excise department is under Zimra. It is understood three trucks from different firms have overturned at the same spot. Docfin Trading director Luckson Dzobo said he has approached his lawyers for legal recourse and recover costs incurred in towing off and repairing his damaged truck. “My truck driver was directed as he entered the border, but the surface was uneven and the truck fell on its side. We invited Raubex and they left promising to assist, but never returned,” he said. The matter was reported under RRB 4770521.
