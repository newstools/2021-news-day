BY WINSTONE ANTONIO DANCEHALL singer Jah Master kicked out all negativity and knocked down all competition as he bagged three gongs at this year’s edition of the annual PPC Zimbabwe-sponsored Zimbabwe Music Awards 2021 (Zima) ceremony hosted virtually on Saturday at Newlands Country Club in Harare. Jah Master, who attracted bad publicity after kicking a fan off stage in Chinhoyi last year, continues to rise to stardom after his “call” to God via his smash song Hello Mwari, appears to have been answered. Sadly, there is no monetary reward to it. Jah Master was dominating the list of the nominees with four nominations alongside fellow chanters Poptain, Jah Master and Nutty O. He scooped the Best Zimdancehall gong, Best Male and Song of the Year (Hello Mwari) award respectively. On the other hand, Hip Hop singer Holy Ten and gospel songbird Janet Manyowa scooped two gongs apiece Holy Ten banged the Best Hip-hop and Best Newcomer while Manyowa scooped Best Album of The Year (Sounds of Victory) and Best Female gongs. The awards spokesperson, Benjamin Nyandoro today told NewsDay Life & Style that ZIMA2021 is a reflection of the great work. “Congratulations to those who released musical materials in 2020. It was a different year. ZIMA2021 is a reflection of the great work. We are all winners. The desire and spirit to do more is more important. Our all-weather friend, PPC, thank you,” he said.
