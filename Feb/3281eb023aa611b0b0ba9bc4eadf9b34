SINOPHARM’S BBIBP-CorV works by teaching the immune system to make antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The antibodies attach to viral proteins, such as the so-called spike proteins that stud its surface. Because the coronaviruses in BBIBP-CorV are dead, they can be injected into the arm without causing COVID-19. Once inside the body, some of the inactivated viruses are swallowed up by a type of immune cell called an antigen-presenting cell. The antigen-presenting cell tears the coronavirus apart and displays some of its fragments on its surface. A so-called helper T cell may detect the fragment. If the fragment fits into one of its surface proteins, the T cell becomes activated and can help recruit other immune cells to respond to the vaccine. Side effects According to a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial carried out at phase 1 and 2 on safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine, the side effects were minimal. Posted in the Lancet journal, the article said the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine BBIBP-CorV is tolerable and immunogenic in healthy people. Normal vaccination reactions It is normal to have certain reactions after a vaccination: There may be redness, swelling or pain around the injection site. Fatigue, fever, headache and aching limbs are also not uncommon in the first three days after vaccination. These normal vaccine reactions are usually mild and subside after a few days. They show that the vaccine is working, because it stimulates the immune system and the body forms antibodies against the infection that is only “feigned” by the vaccination. Likely reactions Pain, redness, stiffness and itching at the area of the vaccination. These symptoms will generally not require any treatment and will pass on their own. Who should not be vaccinated?
• Pregnant women
• Nursing mothers
• People with immunodeficiency diseases
• Woman planning to become pregnant within the near future (3 months from taking the vaccine)
• Children under the age of 16 years
• People with severe allergic reaction to any compon — BBC, New York Times, Egypt Independent, Lancet journal
