BY SHARON SIBINDI AUSTRIA-BASED Zimbabwean imbube crooner Vusa Mkhaya has said he has been receiving threats after he partook in the #DemLoot challenge. The challenge was inspired by the song DemLoot by award-winning journalist Hopewell Chin’ono, which denounces looting of public resources. The song DemLoot has inspired a host of follow-up versions under the banner #DemLoot challenge and after a positive response of his short version, Mkhaya on Monday released a full version of the song he titled #Demloot Bayakapula, which features Victory Siyanqoba director, poet and activist Desire Moyo aka Moyoxide. In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style, Mkhaya said he was not moved by the threats. “I grew up in a household that was Zapu and my DNA is Zapu. I have had a few people coming to my inbox since the release of the short version of DemLoot trying to scare me not to do the full track, but I am not afraid of threats,” he said. “I personally want to see corruption end in Zimbabwe and in other countries around the world. This song is not only for Zimbabwe, but it is for all countries that are still corrupt in one way or the other.” Mkhaya said he featured Moyoxide on the song because of his creativity and boldness to speak about “an epitome of undiluted Satanism”. “I featured Moyoxide because I am a fan of his poems that speak truth to power. Katshay’inja efihl’umphini (He calls a spade a spade). When I started production on the song, I knew that I wanted to feature a poet and Moyoxide was the first poet I called and he did not hesitate,” he said. “The video is a co-production by a few people, I don’t think they will like to be named. My parts were recorded at my home studio using an iPhone. I hope this song will inspire other musicians or artists to speak up and not be afraid to say what they want to say.” Mkhaya said he gave the song two titles because there were many songs titled #DemLoot and there were still more to come. “I wanted our title to talk to those who have no idea what the DemLoot movement is, hence the Bayakapula addition. Some people are calling it the new national anthem on YouTube and I am honoured that they see it that way,” he said.
