BY TERRY MADYAUTA AFTER spending over a year without a club, former FC Platinum defender Kelvin Moyo has finally landed an opportunity to revive his career at reigning Zambian champions, Nkana FC. The 27-year-old completed the move to the Red Devils on Saturday, together with former Harare City full-back Takudzwa Chimwemwe who joined from Buildcon. Moyo, intially targeted a move to Tanzanian side Simba SC, but the deal failed to materialise. Nkana, now under the tutelage of former Highlanders stalwart Kelvin Kaindu, are rebuilding themselves after languish in the drop zone for much of the season. They are 16th on the log standings with 14 points after 12 matches. And Kaindu, who assumed reins at the club in December last year has started rebuilding his squad hoping to form a strong side that can lift the team from the murky waters of relegation and at least ensure a respectable finish in this campaign. Moyo and Chimwemwe are expected to strengthen the Kalampa-based side’s defence together with former Yadah centre back Jimmy Dzingai who is already part of the squad. Warriors goal-minder, Talbert Shumba is also part of the Nkana set-up. “Join us in welcoming Gilroy Chimwemwe who has joined Kalampa from Buildcon FC.
