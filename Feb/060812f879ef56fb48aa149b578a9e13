BY KIMBERLY KARIATI SOUTH AFRICA-BASED Zimbabwean gospel singer Benny Hadassah Muzanamombe says he derives his musical inspiration from the Bible, which he says safeguards his faith and focus. In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style yesterday, the Honde Valley-bred singer said being resilient has enabled him to remain relevant in the cut-throat gospel music sector. “My musical journey began when I completed my Ordinary Level studies at Dzivaresekwa 2 High in Harare, but the road has been bumpy as there were many obstacles in establishing my career,” he said. “I faced a lot of opposition as I met the wrong people at first, but now I do not refer to them as challenges since I am convinced that they were necessary as God was preserving me for the right time.” The award-winning artiste said he was grateful to God as his 2020 album, Murikuvarairwa, won two accolades at Zimbabwe South Africa Gospel Music Awards, adding that his greatest achievement was having one of the tracks Vafudzi Vemakwai ranked number one on Radio Zimbabwe Gospel 50 and National FM Top 50. “I was very surprised that people voted for me as I have few friends. I am excited to know that I spread the word of God and got such an incredible response.” While it remains disputable if musicians are sincere ministers or admirers of worldly things in ministerial garments, Muzanamombe said he was into music to enhance the Kingdom of God by appealing to people’s hearts. “Living in a world characterised by fake prophets and people’s quest for breakthrough and miracles, my lyrics seek to bring back the real meaning to Christianity,” he
said. “I am more of a songwriter and my music offers Christendom an opportunity to self-introspect their commitment to serving God while providing a nonbeliever thirst of the original concentration of God’s word.” Muzanamombe says he is going to release an album in April this year which he hopes will convert many to Christ.
