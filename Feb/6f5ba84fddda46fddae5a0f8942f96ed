BY STAFF REPORTER THE late Daily News assistant editor Maxwell Sibanda will be buried today at his rural home in Mupati village, Chikomba. Sibanda succumbed to renal complications at the Avenues Clinic in Harare on Sunday. He was 52. Associated Newspapers of Zimbabwe (ANZ) chairperson Norman Nyazema said Sibanda was “a grounded and infectiously down to earth” professional who had made immense contributions to the organisation over many years. “We were all numbed and saddened beyond words when we received the terrible news that the heartless hand of death had once again struck our family — with the Grim Reaper taking away this universally loved and respected veteran scribe. “Max was a grounded, infectiously down to earth and infinitely good person who was loyal to our group to the bone — having been with ANZ since the early days of the Daily News two decades ago, and at its improbable relaunch in March 2011. “Our company is now poorer without him and we will miss him deeply. Our heartfelt condolences go to his family and friends, as well as to the entire ANZ and Modus Media family,” Nyazema said. Colleagues in the media fraternity also described Sibanda as a well-grounded mentor who groomed several journalists, particularly in the arts and entertainment sector.
