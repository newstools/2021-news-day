Kabul — Afghanistan spinner Rashid Khan  is set to miss the first Test match against Zimbabwe due to a finger injury on his right arm. Rashid was injured during his stint in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) where he played for Lahore Qalandars. “Rashid Khan is under-treatment by the relevant health officials in UAE and the final call on his inclusion in the first test will be taken after a reassessment of his injury on February 28. “The Test series between Afghanistan and Zimbabwe starts on 2nd March with the first match of the series to be played till 6th March 2021,” the Afghanistan Cricket Board said. The Afghanistan star is currently playing in the PSL 2021 and once again, he gave a glimpse of his batting prowess with a match winning six in the Lahore Qalandars vs Peshawar Zalmi T20 match. Earlier in the match, Khan bowled an economical spell of four overs, leaking just 14 runs for the Qalandars. However, batting at number eight, the maverick spinner scored a quickfire and unbeaten 27 runs off 15 deliveries aided by Mohammed Hafeez’s unbeaten 33 to take their side over
the line while chasing a modest 141-run total set by Peshawar Zalmi. – Online
