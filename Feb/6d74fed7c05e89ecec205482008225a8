BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE Suspended National Pharmaceutical Company of Zimbabwe (NatPharm) acting managing director Zealous Nyabadza appeared at the Harare Magistrates’ Court yesterday facing criminal abuse of office allegations for selling a consignment of surgical masks without authority from his employer. Nyabadza (46) was remanded in custody to today by magistrate Trynos Utawashe pending bail application. The State alleges that Nyabadza took delivery of 28×50 boxes of surgical masks valued at US$54 600 on May 19 last year from Sacred Heart Pharmaceuticals without following proper procurement procedures. The masks were allegedly never received at Strategic Business Unit at Natpharm despite Nyabadza signing for their receipt. He allegedly sold the consignment on the same day to the Zimbabwe Medical Association for US$68 600. Nyabadza allegedly later created a contract which was signed on July 13 last year to cover up his tracks by causing NatPharm to raise an internal purchase requisition, instead of the Strategic Business Unit, which was responsible for the company’s retail function. The matter came to light on July 1, 2020 when the accounts department failed to process the Sacred Heart Pharmaceuticals purchase voucher and invoice from NatPharm due to lack of a quotation, and an attempt to secure the quotation by Nyabadza failed. It is alleged relevant documents, which include the contract that had been signed in retrospect, the delivery note, sales invoice from Sacred Heart Pharmaceuticals, purchase voucher and invoice from NatPharm were duly obtained, which was used in the commission of the offence. The State alleged Nyabadza showed favour to Sacred Heart Pharmaceuticals by offering a contract without following due process.
