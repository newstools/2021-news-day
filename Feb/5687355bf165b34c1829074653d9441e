BY FORTUNE MBELE WARRIORS defender Peter Muduwa  is confident of impressing Simba SC as he ventures into his first Caf Champions League journey with his side facing DRC’ AS Vita at the Stade des Martyrs in Kinshasa tomorrow. Simba SC were drawn in Group A with AS Vita, Egyptian giants Al Ahly and Al-Merreikh of Sudan. The Highlanders defender joined Simba SC last month on a six-month loan from the Bulawayo giants and targets to impress his Tanzanian paymasters to land a permanent transfer. Speaking to NewsDay Sport soon after arriving in the DRC on Wednesday, Muduhwa said he is ready for the adventure that could see him being signed permanently at Simba SC. “Everything was just fine here. I am not under any pressure at all. I’m just hoping and praying that I play and impress the coach (Didier Gomez Da Rosa) and I think I will just do that. I am happy and the environment at Simba is just good. It’s going to be a tough match against AS Vita but we must win,” Muduhwa said. He is among eight other defenders Shomari Kapombe, Joash Onyango, Pascal Wawa, Ibrahim Ame, Erasto Nyoni, Kennedy Juma, Gadiel Michael and Mohamed Hussein who are up for selection. The French tactician Da Rosa travelled with a 27-member squad saying he doesn’t want to face surprises under the COVID-19 circumstances. Muduhwa is only eligible for the Caf Champions League as he was signed after the Tanzania Football Federation transfer window had closed for him to feature in the Vodacom Premier League. His compatriot Perfect Chikwende who also signed for Simba SC last month from FC Platinum will not be playing in the champions league as per the competition rules as he was registered with the Zimbabwean champions for the same tournament. Simba SC beat FC Platinum to proceed to the lucrative group stages of the Caf Champions League.
