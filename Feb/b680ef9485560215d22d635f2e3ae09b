BY TAFADZWA KACHIKO VETERAN actor Stephen “Huni” Chigorimbo was recently honoured with the Award of Meritorious Excellence by an emerging Pan-African filmmakers’ association, African Film Movement (AFM), founded in Nigeria for his contribution to the development of film in Zimbabwe, southern Africa and the continent at large. The legendary actor has rubbed shoulders with international actors such as Denzel Washington as one of the assistant directors for the movie Cry Freedom. Chigorimbo was among the only four people honoured at the inaugural AFM awards hosted in Nigeria recently. Chigorimbo, whose popularity grew from the yesteryear soap opera Studio 263 in which he played the character John Huni, said he was humbled by the recognition. “I am honoured, thank you Africa. It is a feather in the cap for me. It means a lot. African film’s future is firmly in the hands of young people led by AFM,” he said. Nollywood publicist and AFM founder Jamezany James told NewsDay Life & Style that Chigorimbo deserved the recognition as an inspiration to youths in the film industry. “These awards are won strictly by merit. We have found it befitting to recognise Steve (Stephen) for his contribution to the growth of film in Zimbabwe, southern Africa and generally the whole continent,” he said. “He is an inspiration to the contemporary crop of young filmmakers.” The other individuals honoured at the awards ceremony were Kenyan legendary actor Chris Kamau, Nigerian media guru, humanitarian and tourism expert Raphael James and media guru/former commissioner for information in Nigeria’s Kwara State, Mahmoud Ajeigbe.
