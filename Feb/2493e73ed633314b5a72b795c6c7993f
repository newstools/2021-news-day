BY VANESSA GUZHA HARARE City Council (HCC) has resumed water treatment at Prince Edward (PE) plant after switching it off in March 2019 following the decommissioning of Harava Dam. The Prince Edward plant supplies Chitungwiza, Epworth, Ruwa, Hatfield, Sunningdale, Waterfalls and some parts of Mbare. Because of improved supplies, the council said more areas should start receiving water. “Areas like Sentosa, Highlands, Glen Lorne should be receiving water, among many other suburbs,” council spokesperson Michael Chidemhe told NewsDay yesterday.
