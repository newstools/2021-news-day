BY HARRIET CHIKANDIWA FORMER MDC-T employees have approached the High Court seeking a garnishee order against the party’s accounts so that they can recover over US$150 000 owed to them. The workers won a High Court case against the party, but the MDC Alliance failed to play them and they have now turned to MDC-T leader Douglas Mwonzora , who appears set to assume the debt after being voted party leader in December last year. The workers, Wilson Box, Aleck Tebe, Geraldine Sibanda and Lawrence Paganga, through their lawyer Caleb Mucheche, are seeking a garnishee order because the fear that the party will use up money in its coffers before they get their dues. Last year, the MDC-T, under the leadership of Thokozani Khupe promised to pay the workers their US$155 318 upon receipt of its grant from government. “On April 26, 2019, the MDC-T’s legal representatives wrote a letter indicating the MDC-T’s intention to pay the applicants from their government grant to be disbursed in terms of the Political Parties Finance Act as soon as it is availed to the MDC-T,” the papers filed as part of an application by the workers read in part. “To secure payment of the said money to applicants, the applicants have, therefore, approached this honourable court seeking a garnishee order against the MDC-T’s bank account or any other account to which the MDC-T funds are disbursed.” Over 100 workers were fired by the MDC-T including those who have dragged Mwonzora to court together with Justice Legal and Parliamentary Affairs minister Ziyambi Ziyambi. The ex-workers accused the MDC-T of failing or neglecting to pay what it owes despite several demands and capacity to pay. Follow Harriet on Twitter @harrietchikand1
