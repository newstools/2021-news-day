BY SHARON SIBINDI AFTER making waves with his reality show Being Braydan, Bulawayo-based filmmaker Braydan Heart has joined hands with Pishavila Communication and Dropout Films for a new television drama series, Soulmate, which will be shot in the City of Kings and Queens. In a recent interview with NewsDay Life & Style, Heart said they were concluding the pre-production stage, with most of the lead cast and crew locked in. “We are producing a local television drama series that will be shot here in Bulawayo. For the pilot episode, we already have our lead cast, but we need about five supporting roles filled in and we are making a casting call (virtual auditions ended on Monday) looking for actors and models who should send a short video performing a monologue so that we can start principal photography of the pilot episode,” he said. Heart, who is also known for his latest award-winning dystopian film 18 Months Later, which is inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, said due to the virus-induced lockdown, they would be auditioning characters for the rest of the season as they progress with the production. He said the forthcoming drama series would be different from his previous productions as this would be a fictional drama series like Netflix’s Elite or Blood and Water. “The inspiration of his drama series comes from just before premiering 18 Months Later, when script writer and producer Tavaka Matunha approached me with a script of a show and asked me to be an executive producer of his story. The story quickly resonated with me as my production house had been thinking of doing something more toned down compared to 18 Months Later, “he said. Heart said they were open for partnerships for the success of the production.
