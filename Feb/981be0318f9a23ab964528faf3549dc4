BY BEAUTY NYUKE THE ruling Zanu PF is still deliberating on the hero status to be accorded to the late Zimbabwean ambassador to Mozambique, Douglas Nyikayaramba. Nyikayaramba (64) succumbed to COVID-19 on Tuesday in Harare and is most likely destined for the national shrine. Contacted for comment yesterday on Nyikayaramba’s hero status and burial arrangements, Zanu PF spokesperson Simon Khaya Moyo said: “Burial arrangements will be announced soon. Read the President’s condolence message.” However, political analyst Alexander Rusero said it was obvious that Nyikayaramba would be declared a national hero since he was a national liberation war hero, “the most authentic criterion used by Zanu PF since 1980”. In his condolence message on Tuesday, President Emmerson Mnangagwa described Nyikayaramba as a fearless person who contributed immensely to the liberation of the country and its security after independence. Nyikayaramba was famed for declaring that he would never salute the late MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai, labelling him a national security threat. Political analyst Alex Magaisa said Nyakayaramba was one of the generals who were at the forefront of resisting the democratisation of the country. Nyikayaramba becomes the fourth of the November 2017 coup generals to succumb to COVID-19 after former Air Force chief Perrance Shiri (Lands and Agriculture minister), coup announcer Sibusiso Moyo (Foreign Affairs minister) and ex-Prisons boss Paradzai
Zimondi.
