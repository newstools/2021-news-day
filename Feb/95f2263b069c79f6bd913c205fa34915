Dubai based Zimbabwean business woman and human rights activist, Edith Chibhamu has hinted on running for office in the upcoming 2023 presidential elections. Sources close to this development have revealed that Chibhamu is bitter about the uncurbed corruption by top government officials, the deterioration of the health system, poor education, selective rule of law that has seen a continuous abuse of human rights and unfair prosecution of civil society and opposition leaders. “Today Zimbabweans still face glaring injustices and inequality with many living below the poverty datum line with little or no hope of finding meaningful employment, hope has been eroded in the lives of many Zimbabweans. Zimbabwe has just become a ‘basket case’, corruption and bad leadership has not only destroyed the nation, but has reduced it to a mere irony of George Orwell’s Animal farm that “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others”. “This election will shape our country for a generation. It is our opportunity to transform our country, so that it works not just for the elite, but for the majority. It is a chance to deliver the real change Zimbabwe cries for and needs. This manifesto sets out how our government will do that. Our party is built on a strong Biblical foundation that seeks to honor God and put everyone at the center of its policies. We are here to serve Zimbabweans and make sure everyone is safe in a new Zimbabwe that is ripe with opportunities to flourish and grow…” reads part of the Manifesto seen by this publication.
