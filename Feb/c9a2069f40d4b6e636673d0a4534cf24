BY NIZBERT MOYO A SOCIAL soccer player from Nsingo village under Chief Masendu in Plumtree allegedly struck a rival team with an axe after a misunderstanding over the results which he claimed had been tampered with. Matabeleland South provincial police spokesperson Inspector Loveness Mangena confirmed the incident on Monday. Mangena said the accused, Mongisi Ncube (28), whose team name was not named, allegedly axed Fedelis Dube (22) after their two teams drew 2-all during a social soccer match last Saturday. Dube was taken to Plumtree District Hospital for treatment. “On January 30, two social teams were playing soccer at Nsingo playing field when their teams were level on scores. Dube’s team claimed that they had won the game. “A misunderstanding then ensued, resulting in Ncube picking an axe and striking Dube on the chest,’’ Mangena said. The matter was then reported to the police, which led to Ncube’s arrest. Mangena said Ncube would be charged with attempted murder.
