Australia have pulled out of their tour of South Africa in February and March because of coronavirus concerns. The teams were due to play three Tests, subject to bio-secure protocols being agreed. Cricket Australia said it had “no choice” because of the situation in South Africa, where a more contagious variant of the virus has been reported. Director of cricket Graeme Smith said Cricket South Africa was “extremely disappointed by the decision”. He added: “To be informed about the decision at the 11th hour is frustrating.” – BBC SPORT
