BY JAIROS SAUNYAMA ZANU PF Mashonaland East province has ordered party members who are neither district nor provincial co-ordinators to stop forming WhatsApp groups using the party name and logos. The move is meant to curb the spread of false messages about both the party and leaders, with members accused of settling personal scores on social media platforms. According to a letter dated February 23 and signed by provincial secretary for administration Kudzai Majuru, party members have been urged to stop using President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s picture on their WhatsApp groups. “The provincial leadership has noted with concern the mushrooming of social media groups bearing the party name, logo and the President’s picture being abused for various reasons, including settling personal scores,” Majuru said. “Group administrators using the party name, logo and President’s picture are by way of this letter advised to rename their groups and shun using the party name.” Zanu PF party members in most districts of the province have been exchanging harsh words on social media groups, especially after the shambolic district co-ordinating committee (DCC) elections that left the party divided. Majuru added: “However, those with genuine reasons to use party name should seek clearance from the provincial headquarters and get guidelines on what should be avoided when using party name. “Please also note that party co-ordinators will form party district social groups and party officers at province will do so at provincial level and above.” Majuru yesterday confirmed the authenticity of the letter and said the move was meant to bring sanity to the province as well as stopping people from fighting for personal gains using the party name.
