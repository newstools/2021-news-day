BY LORRAINE MUROMO ZIMBABWE Open University (ZOU) students yesterday raised concern over the malfunctioning e-learning system at the institution ahead of end of semester examinations this monthend. ZOU acting spokesperson Stewart Mandiwanza acknowledged that the university was, indeed, facing some challenges. “Notwithstanding the negative effects of COVID-19 on our normal operations, Zimbabwe Open University remains committed to ensure that students receive their tutorials while making sure that lecturers are fully supported in performing their duties,” Mandiwanza told NewsDay. He said the university was reviewing its teaching and learning policies in order to solve some of the problems encountered by the students. Students who spoke to NewsDay alleged that there was chaos at the university, while a leaked audio revealed that the problems emanated from failure by the university to pay for data and other costs. First-year students at the open learning university also claimed that they were still not registered on the MyVista student portal, which enables them to communicate with other students. “We have never even attended a single lecture and yet we are expected to sit for examinations,” one student said. “To date, I have not even submitted any assignments and my MyVista university account is inactive. We also never went for orientation.” Said another aggrieved student: “I feel like the university is only interested in my money because I paid my full fees last year, but no one ever communicated with me thereafter. Each time I contacted the university regional co-ordinator, I was told that the university was still regularising courses so that they are in line with Zimbabwe Council for Higher Education (Zimche)’s new regulations.” Late last year, part-time lecturers accused the institution of denying them allowances for over nine months.
