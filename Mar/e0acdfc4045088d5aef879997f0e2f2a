BY HARRIET CHIKANDIWA THE bulk of infrastructure at the country’s vocational training centres (VTCs) has collapsed due to lack of funding by the State, Parliament heard on Tuesday. This was said by chairperson of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Youth, Mathias Tongofa as he presented a report on the state of VTCs. He said enrolment levels at VTCs had gone down due to inadequate learning infrastructure. For instance, Tongofa said Zvishavane VTC had the capacity to enrol up to 700 students, but only had 450.  At Mashayamombe VTC, he said enrolment had declined from 500 to only 55 students. “The committee observed that learning facilities and buildings at most VTCs were in a state of deterioration. This was evident at Mashayamombe VTC where the administration block had no window panes, and moulds were razing down doors and wood infrastructure as a result of lack of utilisation. “Additionally, the committee was dismayed to note that buildings at Panganai VTC in Insiza district were even collapsing. The deplorable state of the buildings pointed to failure to attract students by Mashayamombe and Panganai VTCs,” Tongofa said. He said most VTCs had obsolete equipment which affected training, with the worst affected being Mashayamombe in Mhondoro-Mubaira district, Magamba in Mutare, Kadoma VTC and Bindura Urban. Tongofa also said there was severe shortage of accommodation for students, adding that lack of start-up capital grossly affected the entrance of graduates into the local industry. Mutasa North MP Trevor Saruwaka (MDC Alliance) said most infrastructure at VTCs depicted
