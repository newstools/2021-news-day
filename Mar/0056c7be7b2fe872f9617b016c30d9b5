The Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education has said private schools are not allowed to set their own calendar.
In a statement, the ministry said it is only government that has the responsibility of determining schools calendar as stipulated by the law. “The ministry takes this opportunity to advise its valued leaners, parents, guardians, teachers and other stakeholders that in terms of the Education (Non-Government Schools Regulations of 2005, Section 9 (1) the secretary shall prepare an annual school calendar to determine the days during each term when pupils shall be required to attend school for instruction,” the statement read.  “All well-meaning public and private schools, including ATS schools, should therefore abide by the Ministry’s 2021 school calendar. Any deviation from the school calendar announced will attract censorship with the sternest penalty being de-registration of the deviant school.”
This came after private schools proposed their own calendar claiming they were conducting online lessons during lockdown. Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) president Takavafira Zhou also called on government to consider revising the three-term 2021 school calendar, arguing that it strains parents financially on school fees, since it was spread over nine months.
