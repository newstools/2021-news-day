BY LIFE & STYLE CORRESPONDENT SOUTH AFRICA-BASED Afro-jazz artiste Precious “Mr P” Hanya has enlisted the services of veteran artistes for a forthcoming Jiti single titled Swederera. On the single, Mr P will feature former sungura singer Alick Macheso’s bassist Obert Gomba, ex-Jah Prayzah’s vocalist Pamela “Gonyeti” Zulu and Bazil Makombe previously with Chimurenga music guru Thomas Mapfumo. In an interview, from his South African base, Mr P said the new single is a party song where he is chastising a married man for not getting cosy with his wife. “The Swederera single is a star-studded project that I am excited to work with an experienced line up of artistes on Swederera. The single is a danceable Jiti track fused with brass and mbira to give an aura of Afro-jazz which is ideal for weddings and parties,” he
said. “The song is about a guy who wants to be close to his wife and warns her about fake people that pretend to like her whilst seeking to destroy their marriage. Drums were done by Obert Gomba and backing vocals by Gonyeti, who was previously with Jah Prayzah.” The 39-year-old musician said the single would be available on major music platforms like iTunes, Deezer, Spotify and YouTube, among others. Mr P started his musical career in Chitungwiza and has so far released two albums namely The Beginning and The Return. In his efforts to assist rising talent, Mr P established a music stable that has benefitted the likes of upcoming artistes such as Charleen Nenzou a.k.a Cici and John Tamuka Masuka, better known as JonWacho/Jonono. Off the stage, Mr P is a qualified electrician and businessman who runs an electrical company and a clothing label. lFollow us on Twitter @NewsDay Zimbabwe
