BY BLESSED MHLANGA GOVERNMENT will begin rolling out an e-learning national strategy for schools to ensure that learning disruptions caused by COVID-19 are
bridged. This was revealed yesterday by Information minister Monica Mutsvangwa during a post-Cabinet Press briefing, where she said the smart education concept would increase the use of ICTs in Zimbabwe’s education sector across the geographical divide. “The national e-learning strategy for schools is part of the SMART Zimbabwe 2030 master plan, which is programme 15 of the Cabinet-approved government priority programmes on innovation,” Mutsvangwa said. She said a manufacturing plant in Msasa, Harare, had the capacity to assemble 150 000 ICT learning gadgets per annum, adding that government was targeting to ensure connectivity to 1 500 schools, electrify 434 schools and manufacture the 150 000 devices as per order. Mutsvangwa said under the programme, each school is expected to be equipped with a computer laboratory comprising 41 computers, a server, a projector, a printer, a white board and connectivity.
