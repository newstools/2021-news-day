Recently performing his hit song Jerusalema around the African continent, Master KG has more to celebrate as the single continues to break records. The music producer attributed the success of Jerusalema in 2020 to social media and the dance challenges that swept the world. People still can’t get enough of it, now streaming on short video app TikTok. The number is a combined total of the dance challenges, different creative takes of Jerusalema and videos such as this one from Ghana, which has been viewed nearly one million times. The success was similar on YouTube, with more than one billion views of all videos combined with the official video (now at 350 million views) and the dance challenges.
