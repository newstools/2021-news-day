BY SHARON SIBINDI BULAWAYO’S all-female ensemble and award-winning a capella group, Nobuntu, says although the COVID-19-induced lockdown had disrupted the Padbank initiative where it distributes sanitary ware to artistes, it was still committed to the project. The group launched the Padbank initiative in 2018 to distribute pads at youth centres in Bulawayo for use by female artistes during rehearsals. The group’s spokesperson Keith Moyo told NewsDay Life & Style that the Padbank was a movement and not an event, therefore, it was difficult for it to suddenly grind to a halt. “The Padbank initiative still exists, but due to COVID-19, we were unable to carry out the exercise in the traditional manner (hosting a concert). Gathering of people has become a potential health hazard, therefore, we could not host a live concert,” he said. “Online concerts are still a challenge in Zimbabwe and monetising that model is still a hurdle we are yet to cross. The COVID-19 era will soon come to an end and that will mean we will go back to normalcy.” Moyo said they had a loyal following which understood the goal of its project, hence donations had been coming in. “For well-wishers who would like to contribute to our Padbank drive, please contact us on our social media platforms or contact 0772831221. Anyone who exceeds 20 packs gets a free Nobuntu gift,” he said. “We want to expand to schools and disadvantaged communities once schools open in an effort to empower and make life better for the girl child.”
