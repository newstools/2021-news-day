BY SHARON SIBINDI AFRO-POP ace Jeys Marabini will face the biggest test of his career with his new reggae track and video, Jah Deliver Us, as he seeks to expand his market and fan base. The award-winning artiste told NewsDay Life & Style that he had always been a reggae fan, hence the decision to release a reggae album to be produced by Dumisani (Ramadu) Moyo. “I have been busy in the studio doing my single and video shooting too. It’s a reggae song … It’s a song I love so much and I feel that people will love it as I came with a different tune from the usual Jeys Marabini that people have become accustomed to,” he said. “I want to show people that I am a diverse musician, I can play anything. I have been a fan of reggae music for a very long time, so I thought of showcasing something fresh and exciting with a good message.” Marabini said the track Jah Deliver Us talked about the world’s problems and it’s hot. “This is an international song, it’s not for Zimbabwe or Africa only, but the international market. The track talks about problems in the world and that the world is burning. For example, we have things like the coronavirus affecting the world. In the song, I am asking who will free Africa, who will free the world from such?” he said. On the upcoming reggae album, Marabini has worked with various artistes such as Alexander Mhlanga, Hudson Simbarashe, Mzoe7 and Bolamba. “I have worked with great musicians like Rodwell Rhoda. Mabhena (bass), Octopus (keyboard), Memory Mthombeni (drums), then on percussions, we have Sjure, while Awah and Nomqhele are the backing vocals,” he
said. Marabini was applauded by the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation last year for helping fellow artistes to produce their music at his backyard studio in Nkulumane 12, Bulawayo.
