BY FREEMAN MAKOPA SOUTH AFRICA-BASED Zimbabwean amapiano star, Sha Sha, continues to scale dizzy heights after her song Overdue, which she featured Tellaman, was used as a soundtrack for an American comedy Coming 2 America. The film, Coming 2 America, which premiered on Amazon Prime last Friday, is a sequel to the 1988 film set three decades ago starring Eddie Murphy, who returns as Prince Akeem Joffer, monarch of the fictional African country, Zamunda. The film evolves on the revelation that Akeen has a long-lost son living in the United States and he (Akeen) must return to America to build a relationship with this unexpected heir to the throne. The award-winning songstress, whose music has earned her the Queen of amapiano tag, took to Instagram to celebrate her milestone. “I am super excited about this one,  (that my song has been used as a soundtrack). I still can’t believe I am a part of this movie I grew up watching. “Insane? When God is your manager, (anything is possible),” she posted. The album, Rhythms of Zamunda: Music Inspired by Coming 2 America also features a number of African artistes among them Nasty C, Tiwa Savage, Prince Kaybee, Fally Ipupa, Diamond Platnumz and Tekno. Born Charmaine Shamiso Mpambiro, Sha Sha’s musical journey has not been that rosy, as she had to fight hard to be where she is, choosing to follow her dreams over her parents, who wanted her to be a nurse.
