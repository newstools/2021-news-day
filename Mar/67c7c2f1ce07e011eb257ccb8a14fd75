By Desmond Chingarande ZIMBABWE Football Association president Felton Kamambo’s trial was once again postponed yesterday to March 30 after the presiding magistrate said she was overwhelmed by other cases. Kamambo, who faces bribery charges, has had his case postponed several times before with the State saying it was not ready for trial. However, this time it was magistrate Bianca Makwande who postponed the trial saying she was overwhelmed by other court cases. The complainant is former Zifa president Philip Chiyangwa, who was contesting against Kamambo. Allegations are that in December 2018, Kamambo offered cash gifts from his EcoCash wallet to Zifa congress voters. The State alleges all the gifts or considerations paid by Kamambo were reportedly meant to induce voters to vote for him. The State alleges that there was no agreement or arrangement in place between the Zifa electoral committee and voters entitling them to receive such considerations or
gifts. As a result of the payments, Kamambo received 35 votes against Chiyangwa’s 24 and was announced the eventual winner.
