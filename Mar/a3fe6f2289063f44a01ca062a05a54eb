BY SHARON SIBINDI BULAWAYO’S up-and-coming writer, poet and Upper Six student at Nkulumane High School, Bright Kevin Rondozai said he drew inspiration from veteran writer Dorcas Maseko. Rondodzai, popularly known as Bright Rond, has penned a second book, Beautiful Paradise, that has won an award at Writers Space Africa-Zimbabwe (WSA-Z). “My writings were motivated by Dorcas Maseko, one of Zimbabwe’s best writers. Actually I am doing it under the tutelage of Albert Nyathi, Dorcas Maseko and Dexter Co-operation,” he said. “Beautiful Paradise is my second book and I have many books to be published, but the challenge I have is of financial resources to publish.” He said his latest book was about a couple, Life (Girl) and Death (Man). “Generally, the book Beautiful Paradise talks about two people in love as life dates death, how death and life were formed…. “Nothing about her was meagre, her captivating beauty had triggered death to say “Will you marry me, my Angel…,” he said. “Although her eyes had begun to glitter, she only managed to nervously jitter…If she said “No” she would regret later. “So in brief, the book teaches us not to trust too much as we see life trusted death and was later disappointed. It teaches us to put our trust in God.” Follow Sharon on Twitter @SibindiSharon
