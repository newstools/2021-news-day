LIVERPOOL — Liverpool have a rich history of turning on the style in Europe to make up for disappointing domestic form, but even a 2-0 first-leg lead over RB Leipzig in their Champions League last-16 tie looks precarious. Jurgen Klopp’s stumbling English champions will approach Wednesday’s second leg with trepidation – knowing they will not even be at Anfield for the “home” match. Liverpool’s dramatic exploits in European competition over the years have been fuelled by the colour, noise and energy provided by fans packed into their famous old stadium. In 2005, Rafael Benitez’s league also-rans were inspired to thrilling wins over Juventus and Chelsea before producing the greatest comeback in Champions League final history in Istanbul against AC Milan. Klopp’s first season in charge, in 2015/16, ended with Liverpool a lowly eighth in the league, but they were roared on as they battled back from 3-1 down to beat Borussia Dortmund 4-3 in the second leg of their Europa League last-eight tie on their way to the final. Arguably the greatest night Anfield has ever seen came against Barcelona in May 2019. The Spanish giants were demolished 4-0 in the second leg of the Champions League semifinal, 24 hours after Manchester City landed a vital blow in a titanic title race with Klopp’s men. Liverpool went on to beat Tottenham in the final to be crowned European champions for a sixth time. But after a year of largely empty stadiums as a result of the coronavirus, Anfield’s fear factor has vanished. Klopp’s men had been unbeaten in 68 Premier League games at home until January, but they have now lost a club-record six in a row. Liverpool’s “home” match against Leipzig will be played in the Puskas Arena in Budapest as a result of COVID-19 travel restrictions, the same stadium that hosted the first leg. — AFP
