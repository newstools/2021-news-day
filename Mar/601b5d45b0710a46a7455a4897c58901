BY PRAISEMORE SITHOLE THE Passengers Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) has embarked on a zero tolerance to corruption campaign in the transport sector to ensure passenger safety. PAZ president Tafadzwa Goliati told NewsDay that the campaign would run under the theme “every voice counts”. “We are demanding transparency and accountability to those who are being given jobs in the transport sector or those providing services in the form of buses and kombis,” Goliati said. “There is organised corruption by the ‘transport mafia’ who control the streets.  In the process, they put the safety of passengers at risk. “Unfortunately for us, the touts whom we can safely refer to as the transport mafia are not arrested.  That raises questions on who they work for. We want to unpack such questions through this campaign,” he said. Commuters are often subjected to abuse by the touts, who sometimes force them to board certain commuter omnibuses, in addition to overcharging them, especially after
hours. Unregistered commuter omnibuses have also caused commotion in most cities as they pick passengers  from undesignated sites. The Bulawayo City Council has joined forces with police to flush out unregistered public service vehicles.
