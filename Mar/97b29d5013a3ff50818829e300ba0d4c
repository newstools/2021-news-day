BY FREEMAN MAKOPA SUNGURA prodigy Mark Ngwazi, famed for his hit song Taurai Madzoka has charmed Nigerian music heavyweights Koredebello and Yemi Alade following their endorsement of his track on Instagram and Tik Tok. The two musicians vibed to the song Taurai Madzoka which has become a hit in most parts of Africa with music pundits asserting that it is Ngwazi’s breakthrough. In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style, Ngwazi said he was excited to see his music traverse borders and make an impact on people’s lives. “I am very excited because it’s one of those things that does not usually happen in sungura music and this shows that I am closer to reaching that stage I have been eyeing all these years. “I believe sungura must go international and I am there to make that happen and this is my plan,” he said. “Having my songs endorsed by Nigerian artistes, is a stepping stone in my career and I think I am on the right track and realising the fruits of my sweat.” Ngwazi said although his journey was marred with obstacles, he had managed to strike the right chord. “The level that I am on now is the best moment to introduce new things. “There is a level where your music will be faltering and not being appreciated, and you decide to follow the trend like other sungura artistes so that your music gains popularity, but I think it’s now the right time to take my music to another level,” he said. “We started off on a hard patch, but I am now able to sustain my family and do other projects. “On Saturday last week I was given a vehicle, (Mercedes Benz E320) by someone who appreciates my music and as for stands, I now have six stands while I am still young with only two kids.” Ngwazi said his resolutions this year were to make money through music as well as take his brand beyond the borders.
