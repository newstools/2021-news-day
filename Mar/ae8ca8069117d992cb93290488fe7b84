BY DESMOND CHINGARANDE HARARE West MP Joanah Mamombe and MDC Alliance activist, Cecilia Chimbiri, who were arrested last Friday for violating COVID-19 regulations, were yesterday denied bail by magistrate Vongai Muchuchuti-Guwiriro. The duo was remanded to March 23. They were arrested after they held a Press conference at the Harare Magistrates Court in protest over the arrest of MDC Alliance committee member, Makomborero Haruziviishe, who was in custody for violating COVID-19 regulations. Mamombe and Chimbiri’s lawyer Jeremiah Bhamu said holding a Press conference was not an offence as they were talking to journalists who are essential workers. But in her ruling, Muchuchuti-Guwiriro said the duo had the propensity to commit other offences while on bail. Meanwhile, two Harare fraudsters appeared in court for duping TM Pick n Pay supermarket of $22 million. The duo, only identified as Chagweda and Jombe, were represented by Tafadzwa Hungwe when they appeared before magistrate Richard Mankosi. They were remanded in custody to today for bail continuation. Allegations were that the pair, working in cahoots with Ronald Mudzingwa and Moses Banda, who are still at large, created an email address purporting to be the supermarket’s finance manager Raymond Matsetswa and chief finance officer Gamuchirai Nyamuzinga. The duo then forged signatures and sent emails to Steward Bank instructing it to debit TM Pick n Pay’s account on four different occasions, resulting in the supermarket losing $22 million. TM Pick n Pay processed the transactions without noticing the difference in email addresses. The offence came to light on March 3, 2021 when TM Pick n Pay Supermarkets head office disputed some of the transactions on their account. A police report was filed, leading to the arrest of the pair.
