BY MTHANDAZO NYONI BUDGET airline fastjet has introduced a new product called Flexi-Go, which provides customers with more flexibility when changing their travel plans at short notice. Under Flexi-Go, customers are offered three product options, which include GoEarlier, GoLater and GoFirm. “We are always exploring new ways of extending value and flexibility to our passengers. The Flexi-Go product, with its three options, is aimed at providing our passengers with total flexibility,” fastjet said in a statement. “Customers can choose to travel on a preceding flight on the same route they are booked on. This is suitable for customers who arrive early at the airport and for customers who would have missed their flights, we now offer an innovative new opportunity to travel later on the same route.” The airline said the introduction of this new product offering reaffirmed its commitment to providing more flexibility to clients. The GoEarlier option offers clients with the opportunity on the day of travel to change their booking to a preceding flight. Complementing the GoEarlier offering, the airline has added the GoLater option, which affords all customers a unique benefit to travel on a subsequent later flight up to three days from the original flight date. The third option, GoFirm introducing a no-show policy, extends greater flexibility to rebook a missed flight to any date in the future on a confirmed seat basis.
