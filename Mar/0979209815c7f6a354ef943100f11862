Staff Reporter Liquid Telecom’s intelligent network remains unaffected by the recent Red Sea subsea cable outages that impacted on many other providers of international connectivity. The pan-African telecommunications group said there was continuity of service to its customers in the 13 countries it operates in during the recent outages of the SEA-ME-WE 5 and EIG submarine cables. “With over 57,700 km of submarine cable fibre linking Africa to Europe, the Middle East and Asia, Liquid Telecom’s subsea network is extensive and offers low latency to global destinations,” Liquid Sea chief executive officer David Eurin said. “Keeping our customers connected is and has always been our number one priority. The recent outage on SEA-ME-WE 5 demonstrates the reliability of our network, as none of our customers were affected.” Liquid Telecom said it operates an intelligent subsea cable system that automatically reroutes network traffic during such outages, thus ensuring service reliability to its resilient architecture. This, the communications solutions provider said, differentiates it from other wholesalers that do not have access to similar infrastructure. During the ongoing SEA-ME-WE 5 sea cable outage and other cable planned maintenance in the same region, Liquid Telecom customers remain unaffected due to the additional capacity across alternate routes, either on parallel routes or alternative paths. “Subsea cables are integral to high-speed data exchanges between continents, making them vital to our connectivity offering to our customers,” Liquid Telecoms said in a statement on Wednesday. “Liquid Telecom has established Liquid Sea as its dedicated international wholesale division to support its global customers to access international connectivity from and into Africa. Liquid Sea can leverage its investment in six submarine cables around the continent, as well as more than 73,000km of fibre connecting tens of thousands of business premises in 13 countries.
