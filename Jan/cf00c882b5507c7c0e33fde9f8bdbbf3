BY SILAS NKALA A WOMAN who, allegedly assisted her boyfriend to rape her 13-year-old daughter, was yesterday granted bail along with her lover by the Bulawayo High Court. The woman (48) and her lover (36), both of Matopo district in Matabeleland South province, were released on $2 000 bail each by High Court judge Justice Thompson Mabhikwa. He remanded their case to February 18, for trial. The names of the accused are withheld to protect the identity of the victim. The court heard that sometime in 2014, the two lovers had a child. They then connived that during the period, the boyfriend would sleep with the 13-year-old minor. The girl would sleep with her mother in the kitchen, but later, the man would sneak into their blankets and rape her. This is said to have happened several times under her mother’s watch until she fell pregnant. Allegations are that at times the mother would allegedly also order the girl to go to her boyfriend’s home regularly to sleep with him. After the girl fell pregnant, her relatives then made a report to the police, which led to the arrest of the two lovers.
