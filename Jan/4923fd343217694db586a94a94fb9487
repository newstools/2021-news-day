He was denied bail by Harare Magistrate Judith Taruvinga, more than a month later, his attempts to apply for bail at the High Court have failed. The State alleges that on July 3, 2020, Moyo and his accomplices, who are still at large, gathered at Copacabana bus terminus and unlawfully addressed people waiting for transport. They allegedly said: “Comrades Zimbabwe has never been ripe for a revolution at any given time than now. It is our time to revolt against this government because I can say this clearly that Emmerson Mnangagwa and Obadiah Moyo (former Health minister), maitiro avo ndeekuparadza isu (their conduct is meant to destroy us).” They also allegedly said that Mnangagwa and Moyo’s conduct lacked wisdom and would destroy Zimbabwe, adding that a revolt was necessary because citizens were being deprived of a bright future.
