PORTLAND — CJ McCollum (pictured) scored 12 of his game-high 37 points in a 19-8, game-opening run on Saturday night, propelling the visiting Portland Trail Blazers to a 125-99 romp over the Sacramento Kings. Damian Lillard contributed 17 points, while Enes Kanter added 11 points and 15 rebounds off the bench for Portland, which won its second straight. Marvin Bagley III had a team-high 15 points for the Kings, who lost for the second straight night. McCollum hit two 3-pointers, a pair of two-pointers and two free throws in the opening 4:44, helping the Trail Blazers build their first double-digit lead of the game. The margin swelled to as many as 16 later in the first period and 21 late in the second before Portland coasted home. The closest Sacramento got in the second half was 17. McCollum shot 13-for-22 overall and 6-for-11 on 3-pointers en route to his second-highest point total of the season. He had 44 in the first week of the season against Houston. Lillard went just 5-for-16 from the field and made only one of his seven 3-point attempts, but he did find time for a team-high six assists. Portland outshot Sacramento 44% to 40.7 and outscored the hosts 51-24 on 3-pointers. Carmelo Anthony (13), Jusuf Nurkic (10) and Gary Trent Jr (10) also scored in double figures for Portland, which matched its season best of one game over 50%.
Nurkic completed a strong all-around game with eight rebounds, five assists, three steals and a block. Rookie Tyrese Haliburton scored in double figures for his sixth straight game for the Kings with 12 points. He also had a season-best-tying eight assists for the second straight night. Hassan Whiteside and Glenn Robinson III had 11 points each, while Harrison Barnes and De’Aaron Fox added 10 apiece for Sacramento, which was coming off a 144-123 thumping at the hands of Toronto on Friday. Bagley and Whiteside shared team-high rebound honours with eight each. — Field Level Media
