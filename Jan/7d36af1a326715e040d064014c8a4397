BY MIRIAM MANGWAYA TWO Chitungwiza men yesterday appeared in court for forging Zimbabwe Schools Examination Council (Zimsec) 2020 June results. Misheck Tawanda Cherera (20) and Zaine Stanley Goreraza (27), both of Chitungwiza, pleaded not guilty of forgery when they appeared before magistrate Denis Mangosi. They were released on $3 000 bail each. It is alleged that on January 22, 2021, Cherera went to Zimsec offices in Mount Pleasant intending to check the authenticity of his Ordinary Level June results for the year 2020. When the officials there checked, they discovered that he had produced a fake result slip with passes which were not appearing on his original slip. He was arrested and he implicated Goreraza. Goreraza also implicated another accomplice, who is still at large. They were remanded to March 3, 2020. Follow Miriam on
