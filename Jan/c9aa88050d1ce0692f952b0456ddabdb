BY KENNEDY NYAVAYA GOSPEL rapper and success coach Mudiwa Hood has described his recent nomination in the Black Entertainment Film, Fashion and Arts Awards (BEFFTA) as the greatest achievement in his life so far. Nominated in the Man of the Year category, Mudiwa is the only Zimbabwean on the list and shares a spot with internationally-acclaimed names including Lewis Hamilton, Didier Drogba, Burna Boy and Marcus Rashford. In an interview with NewsDay Life & Style yesterday, the 35-year-old larger-than-life influencer said he was still shocked, but grateful for the achievement. “It came as a shock to me and to be honest this is one of the biggest achievements in my life because I never imagined being nominated along with great names like Didier Drogba, Rashford and Burna Boy and others,” he said. “Being recognised at such a scale is a big thing and I am grateful because I have won music awards, business ones as well as some for dressing well but this time they were looking more at my leadership skills, charity work and others like the book I wrote recently.” Dubbed “Europe’s biggest award ceremony” the awards were founded in 2009 to celebrate black and ethnic personalities in entertainment, film, fashion, television, arts, philanthropy, sports, leadership and business. This year’s edition will be held virtually according to their website. While winning the award could be a herculean task and definitely comes as a plus, if he brings it home, the multi-award-winning musician and banker by profession insists that his mission is beyond gongs. ”I feel like I have a mandate to motivate the youth, that is why I have remained scandal-free and I am certainly on a path to achieve more through the different work that I am doing,” he said. “I am not able to reveal what most of my plans are because I have to build in silence but I do want to leave a legacy, change lives and build an empire.” But, between the achievements, flamboyance and motivational work have courted public scrutiny as well as massive social media trolling especially directed at his “showy” demeanour. According to Mudiwa, who described his gospel music as a ministry to “convert many to Christ”, attacks on the internet are proof that he is winning in life. “I have to accept that I have put myself in the public space, the attacks are evidence that I am doing something and for me that is confirmation that I am doing something good and I have to accept all that comes with it,” he said.   Follow Kennedy on Twitter @ken_nyavaya
