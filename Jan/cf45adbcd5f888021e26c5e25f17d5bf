BY SHARON SIBINDI SHANGANO Arts Trust in collaboration with female poets from Matabeleland North are working on a women’s project aimed at valuing and conserving water as part of the World Water Day commemorated annually on March 22. Shangano Arts Trust executive producer Petros Ndhlovu told NewsDay Life & Style yesterday that the project that features 20 female poets and runs under the theme Valuing Water will be screamed live on the trust’s social media platforms from 2pm to 4pm. “We join the rest of the world on social media in the digital campaign #water2me. Preparations have begun and this is our first time doing the celebrations that come through our established Women in Arts project which is running in the province where women share ideas and collaborate on artwork,” he said. “We have female poets such as Euner Munzamba from Hwange, Providence Moyo from Tsholotsho, Nozizwe Mudenda from Binga, Anna Taonga from Victoria falls among other poets in Matabeleland North who will showcase their talents on the day.” Ndhlovu said as the country faced serious water challenges, children and women were the most affected as they were forced to walk long distances to look for water. “There is need to celebrate the water day. Poets as part of this women project will be advocating for clear, safe and adequate water to all the people. We will also spice up the day with dialogue meetings on our social media platforms on water,” he said. “The World Water Day is important to Shangano Arts Trust because we believe that water is life. Water means different things to different people in different settings. In our cultural, religious and spiritual places, water can mean a connection with creation or community. In natural spaces, water can mean peace and preservation.”  Follow Sharon on
