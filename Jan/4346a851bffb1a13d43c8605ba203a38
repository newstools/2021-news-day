2021 couldnâ€™t come quickly enough for most of us, yet as we move through 2021 Lockdown restrictions are still in place with a great many people remote working unless they happen to be one of those very important key workers.  The restrictions that social distancing brings are vital to counteracting the threat of the CoronaVirus and the resulting Covid19 as there is no-one that wants to carry on living in a world where a pandemic runs riot for a longer period. Although having to stay at home in order to take care of those we love as well as the larger community is so important it can also prove to be very frustrating and boring for many who are used to leading an active life, luckily we do have the internet which is now acting as a virtual life-line for many.
