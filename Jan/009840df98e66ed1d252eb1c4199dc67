BY MOSES MUGUGUNYEKI THREE Zimbabwean writers have been shortlisted for the Mulher Forte African Literature Awards, a regional honour for those who contribute to literature activities in Africa. The Mulher Forte African Literature Awards are the brainchild of a young Batswana woman Paula Otukile. Veteran writer Chirikure Chirikure, Fungai Jayaguru and Elizabeth Taderera are among a number of African writers shortlisted for the awards. Several categories are up for grabs including, Best Performers in Poetry, Best Publishing House, Best Young Novelist, Best Poetry Author, Best Children’s Story Writer, Best Folklore Writer, Best Traditional Music Dancer, Best Traditional Music Singer, Best Orator, Best Illustrator, Legendary Awards and Reader of the Year, among others. Taderera was nominated for the Young Novelist category while Chirikure Chirikure will be recognised for his impressive continued support to the growth of literature in Zimbabwe and Africa in the Legendary Honour category. Another novelist Jayaguru, whose literature work on gender-based violence and sexual abuse was highlighted on the Mulher Forte African Literature webinars for African writer discussions in December last year, is among the nominees. Peter Masukuta, a Zimbabwean arts administrator is among the organisers of the awards ceremony that has been slated for March 7 in Mahalapye, Botswana. “Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, hefty measures would be observed and in any case a live digital presentation shall substitute the much-anticipated event,” the organisers said in a statement. “The prizes are simply an award that shall cement the good work the participants do.” Mulher Forte African Literature MD Otukile said she was planning to make the awards an annual event, so as to grow and cultivate African literature. l Follow Moses on Twitter @mmugugunyeki2
