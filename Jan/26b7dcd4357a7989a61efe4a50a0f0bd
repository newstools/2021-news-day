The Ethiopian government says it has arrested a key founding member of the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The ministry of defence said Sebhat Nega who is now in his 80s was found hiding in a remote area of Tigray. Since early November Ethiopia’s military has been fighting the TPLF which used to govern the region.  On Thursday the military said several other senior TPLF members had been killed or arrested. The UN has described the humanitarian situation in Tigray as dire with 1.3 million people in need of aid as a result of the conflict. It said food supplies are very limited and schools, hospitals and administrative offices have been looted. – BBC
