In a reciprocal measure, Mozambique has, since Thursday, been barring travellers from South Africa with a South African Covid-19 rapid test result from entering national territory. South African authorities have refused, since the beginning of the week, to allow Mozambican citizens with rapid tests to enter their country, demanding the allegedly more credible PCR tests carried out in laboratories. The provincial director of health in Maputo, Yolanda dos Santos, appealed to Mozambicans intending to travel to South Africa not to do so without the PCR test, as they will not be able to cross the border. Border movement at Ressano Garcia started to flow with relative normality on Thursday, after a five-day ordeal for thousands of travellers, including miners, tourists, patients and students. Minister of Health Armindo Tiago gave assurances that the sector was investigating the origin of the Covid-19 fake tests among travellers, in order to determine whether health sector employees were involved in their origin and to guide responses. The National Criminal Investigation Service (Sernic) says that investigations were producing encouraging results, and the force will name anybody responsible for the sale of fake Covid-19 tests results as soon as possible. â€“ BBC
