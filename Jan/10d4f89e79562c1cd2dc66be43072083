Burial for people who have succumbed to #Covid19 will now take place in the area where the person would have died, the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has announced. In a statement, ZRP said the ban will be imposed immediately to combat the spread of #Covi19. “The Zimbabwe Republic police advises the public that the Ministry of Health and Child Care has informed the police of immediate restrictions imposed on the movement of dead bodies in the country. “A body will now be buried in the town/city where the death would have taken place. This is being done in order to curtail the spread of the #Covid19 pandemic,” read the statement.  ZRP said authorisation for movement will only be granted to bodies that will immediately be taken for burial, and there will be no body viewing. “Police will only clear body movements for burial straight from a funeral parlour/hospital mortuary to the burial site. No body viewing will be allowed. Bodies will not be taken home,” ZRP said. ZRP said physical distance should be observed during burial.  Zimbabwe last week recorded its highest number of positive cases — above 1 000 inside 24 hours and 34 deaths in the same period. To date, the country has recorded 21 477 cases, 12 582 recoveries and 507 deaths, a worrying trend as most parts of the world have are grappling with the second wave of #Covid19.
