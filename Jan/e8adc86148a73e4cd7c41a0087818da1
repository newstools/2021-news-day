BY NIZBERT MOYO A BULAWAYO man last week allegedly assaulted his wife with stones and booted feet in a bushy area over an undisclosed misunderstanding leading to her death. Bulawayo provincial police spokesperson, Inspector Abednico Ncube confirmed the incident. The accused, Craig Walters (43) allegedly killed his wife Merilyn Walters (38) on January 24. Both lived in Trenance. “Allegations are that on January 24, Walters was with his wife Merilyn at a bushy area behind Number Two Bulawayo Drive, in Trenance, when they had a misunderstanding over an undisclosed issue. Walters then assaulted his wife with stones, fists and booted feet and left her lying on the ground helpless, before proceeding to his place of residence,’’ Ncube said. He said on the same day at night, Walters took his children aged 18 and 14 years to the bushy area and they carried Merilyn home. Their daughter phoned her uncle to notify him about the critical condition of her mother. The uncle reported the matter to the police who, upon arrival at the Walters residence, found Merilyn dead. Ncube said the police, who attended to the scene, discovered that the deceased had injuries all over her body and her clothes were soaked in blood.
