BY MOSES MUGUGUNYEKI Dondo, who was also the CEO of Impala Car Hire, died on Saturday morning in the capital.HARARE businessman and music promoter Thompson Kanganwirai Dondo (pictured) was yesterday laid to rest at his rural home in Hokonya Village, Chivhu under Health ministry COVID-19 guidelines. He was 48. A church service was held yesterday morning at Nyaradzo Funeral Parlour before his body was taken to Impala Car Hire premises in Hillside. Only a handful of people were allowed to attend the wake in accordance with the COVID-19 regulations. His body was later ferried to his rural home in Hokonya village, 25km outside Chivhu town, where it was interred in the afternoon. Meanwhile, condolence messages continued to pour in with artistes saying the music industry in Zimbabwe was left poorer with the passing of Dondo, who was fondly known as Chikonamombe in showbiz circles. The National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ) director Nicholas Moyo said the death of Dondo had robbed the arts sector of an all-weather friend who was always on standby to support artistes and arts projects. “Mr Dondo was heavily involved in the arts through his promotions company as well his other companies like Fast Fit Matlock and Impala which sponsored prominent arts events including the National Arts Merit Awards,” Moyo said. Music producer Munya “Vialy” Viya described him as a rare breed of a music promoter who helped a number of musicians. “He was just into music and he supported every musician who sought help from him. He even worked with big players in the game like the late Mudhara Tuku and many others,” said Viya. The Canada-based producer has worked with Dondo on a number of projects, including on Allan Chimbetu’s recent album Urgent Matter. “We were working on a new project for this year, but unfortunately he is gone,” Viya said. Dondo is survived by his wife Matirasa and three children, Ruvarashe, Ngonidzashe and Mudiwa. l Follow Moses on Twitter @mmugugunyeki2
