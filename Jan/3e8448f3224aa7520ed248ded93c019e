BY FORTUNE MBELE WARRIORS right-back Tendayi Darikwa’s future at his English Championship side Nottingham Forest looks uncertain as the club has opened up to shipping him out this month. His contract expires in June at The Reds but of late he has struggled for game time. According to Nottinghamshirelive, Darikwa has not been in action for The Reds since March last year and although coach Chris Hughton speaks highly of his commitment, he doubts on hanging onto the defender, suggesting he moves elsewhere this month for game time. Forest are said to be cutting numbers in their squad and there is a high likelihood Darikwa could be leaving during this transfer window. “We have always been very open with Tendayi. He is a really good individual, a good trainer and a good player. But it’s a good while, even before my time, since he is played. He is one that if there is an opportunity for him to get games elsewhere, then I think that’s an opportunity we would accept and he would take,” Hughtom said. He added: “But having said that, he pushes everyday in training. And although he has not been involved, I wouldn’t be too fearful of involving him. It’s only that he has not played for a while. But his levels have been good and he has played some Under-23 games, and is an incredibly good professional.” Cyrus Christie, on loan from Fulham, has been the trusted right-back at Nottingham Forest with Carl Jenkinson providing cover, rendering Darikwa excess and to look elsewhere for game time. Darikwa suffered a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament before the end of the previous season, bouncing back at the end of the season as an unused substitute. The defender has, however, played vital roles in the Warriors’ World Cup and Africa Cup of Nations campaigns. Follow Fortune on Twitter @fmbele
