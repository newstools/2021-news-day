JOHANNESBURG – The Presidency has announced that Minister in the Presidency Jackson Mthembu tested positive for COVID-19. Mthembu took the test earlier on Monday after showing some symptoms. “As per the COVID-19 regulations, Minister Mthembu as well as those who have come in contact with him will immediately self-quarantine,” the Presidency said through a statement.  Mthembu is the fourth member of the executive who has tested positive in the past week, along with Employment and Labour Deputy Minister Boitumelo Moloi, Water and Sanitation Deputy Minister David Mahlobo, as well as governance’s Obed Bapela.

The Presidency said the minister remained in high spirits and wishes all those also fighting the coronavirus a speedy recovery. – Eyewitness News
