In a notice on Friday, town clerk Christopher Dube said: “Notice is hereby given in terms of section 290 of the Urban Councils Act Chapter 29:15 that subject to the consent of the Minister of Local Government and Public Works being obtained, council is proposing to borrow $ 4 223 548 498 or its equivalent US$51 886 345 to finance capital projects.” Dube said US$17 822 048 ($1 450 714 698) was required for water infrastructure rehabilitation, US$4 089 803 ($332 910 000) for sewerage infrastructure, US$10 607 494 ($863 450 000) for acquisition and development of land, US$10 992 000 ($894 748 800) for roads construction and rehabilitation US$5 000 000 or $407 000 000 for a new landfill site and cell development while US$3 375 000 ($274 725 000) is needed for acquisition of plant, equipment and vehicles.
