Five India players are isolating as a precaution after a video on social media showed them eating indoors at a Melbourne restaurant. Rohit Sharma, Rishabh Pant, Shubman Gill, Prithvi Shaw and Navdeep Saini – all part of India’s Test squad to play Australia – will be isolated from other players but are still able to train. Both teams are investigating to determine whether bio-secure protocols for the tour have been breached. The third Test begins on 6 January. The tour is being played with restrictions to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. While in Melbourne, where the recent second Test was played, players and staff are allowed to leave their hotel but if they attend a restaurant they must remain outdoors. An India supporter posted a video on social media of the five players eating indoors at a restaurant on New Year’s Day. “The BCCI [Board of Control for Cricket in India] and CA [Cricket Australia] are investigating the matter and seeking to determine whether the outing constitutes a breach of biosecurity protocols,” a Cricket Australia statement said. “In the interim, on the advice of the Australian and Indian medical teams, the aforementioned players have been placed in isolation as a precaution. “This will include separating the group of players from the broader Indian and Australian squads when traveling and at the training venue.” On Monday the teams are due to travel from Melbourne to Sydney for the third Test which will be played at the Sydney Cricket Ground. No details were given on whether the five players would be able to play in Sydney. Pant and Gill both played in the second Test, which India won to level the four-Test series, while vice-captain Rohit was expected to play in the third, having recently quarantined for 14 days to join the squad late after injury. – BBC
