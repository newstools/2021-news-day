BY SIMBARASHE SITHOLE TWO machete-wielding robbers who pounced on a couple and allegedly robbed them of valuables before raping the wife have been arrested. The two Steward Hurombo (31) and Brian Goto (24) were not asked to plead to the charges by Bindura magistrate Ethel Chichera who remanded them in custody to January 14. The State, led by Edward Katsvairo, alleged that on August 29 last year the duo broke into the complainantsâ€™ cabin (names withheld to protect the rape victim) and impersonated police detectives before demanding mobile phones from the couple. They tied the two together with shoe laces. They robbed them of a solar panel, amplifier and US$260. The duo force-marched the wife to a bush where they raped her. The police used one of the stolen mobile phone to track the duo and the cell phones were recovered. l Follow us on Twitter @newsdayzimbabwe
