BY PATRICIA SIBANDA AT least 11 primary schools in Bulilima district, Matabeleland South province, have succumbed to either hailstorm pressure or old age as most of the structures are too old, with some of them built during the colonial era, Southern Eye has learnt. The revelations were made by Bulilima Rural District Council chief executive John Brown Ncube yesterday. “The schools that have been affected by either of the two as of 2019, to date, include Hingwe, Tsukura, Tamabala, Ngotwane, Goba, Gambu, Gonde, Mute, Gala, Tshompani and Phakama primary schools. This year, I have managed to identify seven primary schools out of those,” he said. “This year and last year we haven’t really experienced a violent storm hence a combination of issues. For instance, some of the schools are now old as they were established about 40 to 50 years ago.” Ncube said some of the schools were aged hence that affected them regardless of the materials used in construction. He added that some of the affected schools had been repaired using devolution funds. Ncube also added that they were working with the Forestry Commission of Zimbabwe to plant trees that would act as windbreakers. Follow Patricia on Twitter @patriciasiband
