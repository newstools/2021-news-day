BY KENNETH NYANGANI THE Mutare City Council has appointed Antony Mutara its acting town clerk following the death of Joshua Maligwa.
Maligwa succumbed to COVID-19 a fortnight ago. Mutara, who is the city health director, was appointed acting town clerk at last week’s full council meeting which was held at the Civic Centre. During the meeting, a minute of silence was observed in honour of Maligwa who passed away on January 5. Farai Bhiza was elected the deputy mayor to replace Kudakwashe Chisango, who was recalled by the MDC-T led by Douglas Mwonzora late last year.
Mwonzora recalled seven of the 19 Mutare city councillors. Mutare mayor Blessing Tandi confirmed the development to NewsDay yesterday. “We had a special full council meeting last week and we appointed Mutara as our acting town clerk,” Tandi said. “As council, we need to move on and deliver service to our people. There is need to pursue an aggressive investment drive to widen the revenue base in the city. I, therefore, call upon council management and policymakers to work as a team in order to achieve progress in council projects,” he said. Tandi also said that he was worried that residents were not paying rates. “I am very worried that our residents are not paying rates. We urge people to pay up their bills.” Meanwhile, Tandi said the City of Mutare had made strides in testing people for COVID-19. He said they had been doing so for free in collaboration with the Health and Child Care ministry. The programme was rolled out last week at three centres in the city.
