President Edgar Lungu has terminated the appointment of Mansa Central lawmaker, Dr Chitalu Chilufya as Health Minister. Chilufya is reportedly linked to a financial scandal involving the supply of $17 million worth of medicine, unearthed by the Auditor Generalâ€™s Office and the Parliamentary Accounts Committee. It has since been established that a supplier, Honeybee, supplied leaking condoms, gloves and fake medicine.  Meanwhile, Bwana Mkubwa Member of Parliament and Water Affairs Minister, Dr. Jonas Kamima Chanda, has been appointed new Health Minister.
