BY STEPHEN CHADENGA THE Gweru City Council has embarked on the green city initiative as part of its efforts to ensure environmental sustainability. Gweru mayor Josiah Makombe said the green city initiative would be an ongoing exercise, which council recently started with the greening of streets and parks as the first phase. “The city has embarked on greening of Lobengula Road from corner of Eighth Street to Kopje Road,” Makombe told NewsDay yesterday. “Maintenance of the Civic Centre Park and greening of Robert Mugabe Street is an ongoing exercise,” he said. However, Makombe said the project completion was being hindered by the fact that the local authority had old tractors, adding that the city’s tractor-drawn slashers were constantly breaking down. He said despite the challenges, the city would continue to provide recreational facilities, parks and greenbelts for its residents. Makombe said Gweru, which is the capital of the Midlands province, would endeavour to preserve its wetlands and other areas that were ecologically sensitive. The city boss also said council would soon launch a waste management plan since most of the waste was bio-degradable material that could be turned into green energy. “As one of the ways to address the solid waste challenges that the city is facing, we will be launching a five-year Gweru integrated waste management plan. “The emphasis on the contents of the plan is the third concept of reduction at source, reuse of materials and recycling. The plan will unlock the value of waste through various waste-to-energy activities and recycling among other waste income generating projects.” Environmental experts said the gas that forms from decomposing rubbish and refuse escapes into the atmosphere contributing to greenhouse gasses which add to climate change.
