Mashonaland Central province police spokesperson Inspector Milton Mundembe confirmed the arrest of Chaparadza Zienderana (62) of Aerodrome, Bindura yesterday saying he was speeding and failed to apply brakes on time, resulting in the vehicle he was using to illegally ply the route hitting Tafadzwa Sakupwanya, who was crossing the road.
