By SIMBARASHE SITHOLE A BINDURA-BASED bar manager, who was selling beer through the window, was slapped with $20 000 fine yesterday by Bindura magistrate Ethel Chichera. Denford Kurima (50) pleaded guilty to the charge and was ordered to pay half of the amount yesterday; failure to pay the fine will earn him three months in jail. The court heard that on Tuesday, the police pounced at a bar in Chiwaridzo high-density suburb, Bindura and saw Kurima selling beer through the window. The police forced entry into the bar and while they were inside, a patron bought beer using a US$20 note and the police took the money and empty bottles as exhibit. The police arrested Kurima who was selling beer illegally after it was banned during the lockdown. Follow us on Twitter@NewsDayZimbabwe
