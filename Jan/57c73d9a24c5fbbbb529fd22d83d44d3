BY NIZBERT MOYO THE Meteorological Services Department has urged farmers to plant early maturing crops amid indications that the rainy season would end in March. Bulawayo provincial meteorological officer Chiposi Ngulube told Southern Eye that farmers should not risk planting crops that would take long to mature. “Farmers should not take a risk, they should start planting early maturing crops if they wish to continue farming and we are likely to announce the end of the rainy season towards the end of March,’’ Ngulube said. He said the country was expecting more rainfall activity in February. Ngulube said they were monitoring Cyclone Eloise brewing in the Indian Ocean, which was projected to hit Mozambique, and bring large amounts of rain into the Beitbridge/Limpopo area. Agritex provincial agronomist Davison Masendeke also said it a bit late for most of the crops to be planted except those that take 90 days to mature. Follow Nizbert on Twitter @N.M
