BY LORRAINE MUROMO THE Zimbabwe Gender Commission (ZGC) has bemoaned the plight of women during the deteriorating COVID-19 situation in the country.
ZGC chief executive Virginia Muwanigwa said although both genders suffered the effects of the pandemic, women were the worst affected. “Women and men are both affected by the pandemic. Both are susceptible to infection. However, societal, in addition to biological factors, increase women’s burden,” she said. “As primary caregivers in the family, including for the people recovering from home, women are, therefore, more exposed.”
Muwanigwa said women were more exposed due to the various chores they carry out at the homestead hence self-isolation was not practical. “Even if someone is self-isolating, someone in the family has to clean their room, has to cook for them and if incapacitated, feed them, and has to wash their clothes. And these are perceived in the average home as women’s roles.” Muwanigwa said. “The guidelines may prescribe total isolation, but we know that this is impossible for some based on class. Manoeuvring the social distancing protocols happens within a context and that outlines who does what within the family functions.” A recent research conducted by Plan International indicated that women and children were the biggest victims of the pandemic. The research also indicated that economic challenges during the pandemic posed a serious threat to young women’s work and business activities and exposed them to increased risk of exploitation and abuse and as a result, women facing severe economic shocks more likely took up high-risk work for their economic survival. Follow Lorraine on
