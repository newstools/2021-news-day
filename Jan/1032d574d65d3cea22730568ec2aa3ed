BY HARRIET CHIKANDIWA HIGH Court judge Justice Benjamin Chikowero yesterday dismissed a bail appeal by former Harare City Council human capital director and acting town clerk Cainos Chingombe who is facing allegations of criminal abuse of office. Chingombe was arrested last year by Special Anti-Corruption Unit (Sacu) for alleged criminal abuse of office and allegedly defrauding Harare City Council of millions of dollars through dubious transactions. Justice Chikowero dismissed the bail appeal despite agreeing that the magistrate who initially dealt with the matter misdirected herself. Chingombeâ€™s lawyer, Lovemore Madhuku said the judge took it upon himself to dismiss the appeal, therefore, they are going to approach the Supreme Court. Allegations are that on October 30, 2014, Chingombe working in collusion with other council employees transferred US$130 000 from the traditional beer levy account into his personal account. It is alleged that he used US$119 000 to purchase a Land Cruiser Prado which he registered in his name, before he pocketed the difference amounting to US$11 000 which he later refunded through deductions from his salary. The council boss, on top of gobbling over US$500 000 a month in salaries, also unprocedurally used over US$530 000 of unbudgeted funds to purchase top-of-the-range vehicles that include a Jeep Grand Cherokee, Toyota Land Cruiser 200 series, Toyota Land Cruiser pickup, a Land Rover Discovery and Toyota Land Cruiser Prado. Chingombe was recently reinstated by the opposition-dominated council after a full council meeting despite an audit report that fingered him in a litany of allegations that led to his dismissal in 2018.
