Government officials from Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan are once again holding talks in a bid to try to resolve a long running dispute triggered by the construction of a huge dam on the River Nile. In July last year the reservoir of the hydro electric dam in the west of Ethiopia started filling with water despite the breakdown of talks between the three countries. The Addis Ababa government is determined to provide electricity for its population and will also export power. But Egypt is concerned that during years of drought its water supply will be greatly reduced. Sudan has warned Ethiopia not to proceed with the second stage of filling the dam before an agreement is reached. The latest round of talks mediated by the African Union will involve the officials meeting virtually. â€“ BBC
