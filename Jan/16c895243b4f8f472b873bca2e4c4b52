The Zambian FA has banned a local coach from its activities after he was convicted of raping and infecting a juvenile with syphilis and HIV, the virus that causes Aids. Former Zambia player Dudley Fichite is currently serving a life sentence for the offence but has lately been sitting on the bench for the Prison Leopards team, which is sponsored by the Zambia Correctional Services. Following a public outcry, the Football Association of Zambia (Faz) has written to Leopard asking them to withdraw Fichite from their technical bench. Faz general secretary Adrian Kashala fears Fichite’s presence may bring the name of the game into disrepute. – BBC
