BY FORTUNE MBELE HIGHLANDERS have been offered a chance to buy Under-20 captain Lexington Mujokoro or take him on loan by the midfielder’s parent club First Mobile Sports Academy (FMSA) but the club is struggling to raise funds to complete the deal. An FMSA official, who declined to be named yesterday said they met with the Bulawayo giants and offers were made but Highlanders emerged from the discussions saying they wanted to make further consultations. “They came and we negotiated. We asked them if they wanted Mujokoro on loan or an outright buy and they said they don’t have money. We don’t have a problem with the loan. They offered US$1 500 for a season’s loan but that is ridiculous,” the official said. At the negotiating table, Highlanders said they would take Mujokoro on loan on condition the Bulawayo giants were to benefit if the player was to be sold while on loan. “To that we obviously said no. Highlanders should not behave as if they are doing us a favour. Mujokoro remains 100% FMSA and we can take this player anywhere,” the FMSA official said. Another source at Highlanders said the Bulawayo giants were calling off the negotiations and the deal with Mujokoro had crumbled.
