BY NIZBERT MOYO THREE Bulawayo men were on Friday arrested by the police after they were found in possession of ivory. They were nabbed after the police got a tip off from a whistleblower. The trio will appear in court after investigations have been completed. Bulawayo police spokesperson Inspector Abednico Ncube yesterday said the arrests were made in collaboration with members of the Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority in Bulawayo. The three are Leonard Murwira (48) from Magwegwe, Enock Mhlanga (62) from Malindela and Pius Ntini (30). “On January 14, information was received to the effect that the three were in possession of raw ivory. “On the same day, the police and National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority officials reacted to the information and found a Nissan March registration number AET2971 parked at TM Pick n Pay in Bradfied,’’ Ncube said. He said a search was carried out on the vehicle and they found five pieces of ivory, after which Murwira and Mhlanga were asked to produce a licence. They failed to produce one, leading to their arrest and recovery of the ivory. Ncube said after further investigations, Murwira implicated Ntini as the owner of the ivory. He said Murwira indicated that he and Mhlanga were only looking for buyers on behalf of Ntini. Ncube said the total value of the recovered ivory was yet to be established as investigations were still in progress.
